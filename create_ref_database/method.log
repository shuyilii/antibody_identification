1.Extracting the trimmed sequence from the original file
  Extracting:
    > ID | v_segment | isotype | v_start | q_start
    trimmed_sequence
    And transform it to a fasta file.
    Can choose if needed to extract to aa sequence or nt sequence
  Filter:
    a-The sequence that is not productive and has stop codon.
    b-Only select the sequence that belongs to the IgG isosubtype.
  Modification:
    Update the V-region ID in the original file with the IMGT database.
    IGHV1-c* = 1-38-4*
    ...f* = 69-2*
    ...d* = 38-3*
    ...h* = 69-1*
    ...b* = 38-2*
    ...a* = 10-1*
    IGHV2-5*10 = IGHV2-5*02
    IGHV2-5*07 = IGHV2-5*04
    IGHV3-43D*01 = IGHV3-43D*03

2.Create the reference database
  Create the full length sequence for each trimmed sequences
    Add the remain v region using the information v_start and q_start.
      v_start: the position of the v region starts of the trimmed sequence
      q_start - 1 : the number of the v region mismatches at the head of the sequence.
      Deal with the chimeric sequence: if the mismatches > 20, than we regard it as a chimeric sequence.
    Add the remain c region using blastn
      Only take the one with the highest blast score.
      Deal with the query that has no hits.
      Deal with the query that has multiple hits.
